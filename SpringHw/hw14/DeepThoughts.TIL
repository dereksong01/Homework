Q1: From any starting position, can an open tour always be found? Explain.

For an even board, if the board is partitioned into four congruent squares and if there is a possible solution with a starting point within that square, then there are potentially four solutions. For an odd board, it is the same case however, it would only be potentially two solutions.

Q2: Same, but for closed tour.
