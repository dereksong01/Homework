Episode 11 - "The Immortals"

I found it interesting that there was a princess named Enheduanna wrote poetry and was the first one to actually sign their work and we were able to find that work. I also found it interesting how there was a spinoff, in a way, of the story of Noah's Ark in the episode. I feel like there is so much to discover in the universe but all the answers will be controversial due to the numerous religions that are present.
