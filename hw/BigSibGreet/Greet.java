/* Number 4 (compare and contrast)
I believe the similarity amongst all three languages are that they all end up 
conducting the task at the end. However, in Java, there seems to be more parameters
and certain words that make certain things happen, whereas Python and Scheme do not
have as complicated codes for displaying "Hello, world!"
