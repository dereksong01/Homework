THIS IS ON A 5X5 GRID
1) Place thy knight on the center because it gives you maximum area to move around.
2) Move thy knight on the perimeter and continue moving around the perimeter with the L shape. Moving one space off of the perimeter is inevitable but one can move back onto the perimeter with the next move.
3) Continue this process in a circle. (Does not matter which direction as long as it is consistent)

(Just a note. With this I went from having 6 boxes blank to only got two boxes blank. So, I think that this process is the ideal method)
