HW#01 -- ...We Go!

I am currently on an expedition to find my lost ducky. However, news have told me that my ducky is currently going under metamorphosis, a process that a majority of duckies go when there are left unattended for a while. A new ducky requires a new name. Thus, I decided to pass on my legacy and name it Derek Jr.. Hopefully, my ducky accompanies me wherever I go and whenever I have trouble, my ducky will be there to aid me on the way. When the process is over, I will proudly carry my ducky around and claim that it is a CHANGED ducky. It is no longer a young ducky. It is a mature, adolescent ducky.
